# Which running programs the installer closes before it installs, updates or
# uninstalls. electron-builder asks for this file by name (`nsis.include` in
# electron-builder.config.js).
#
# electron-builder's own check (templates/nsis/include/
# allowOnlyOneInstallerInstance.nsh) closes every program whose path starts
# with the install directory, compared as text: "...\Programs\autogpt" is
# also the start of "...\Programs\autogpt-voice". The normal app's installer
# would stop a running variant and its database with it, on every update,
# and a variant's would stop any variant whose slug begins with its own.
#
# The three macros below are electron-builder's, with two changes. The path
# must start with the install directory followed by a backslash. And the
# programs found are counted as a list: PowerShell gives no count for a
# single one, so the template's check does not see the last program of an
# app, such as a runtime whose window has gone. Defining
# customCheckAppRunning is how the template is told to use these macros
# instead of its own. test/packaging.test.js compares them with the
# template, so an electron-builder that changes its check is noticed.

# The template leaves these two out when customCheckAppRunning is defined.

# How an update removes the version it replaces.
#
# electron-builder's uninstaller (templates/nsis/uninstaller.nsh), run by the
# next version's installer, moves the old install out of the way one file at
# a time before it deletes it, so that a file still in use leaves everything
# where it was. For this app that is a rename for each of its twenty thousand
# files, each one looked at by the virus scanner.
#
# One rename of the directory does the same: Windows refuses it while any
# program inside is running or any file inside is open, and then nothing has
# moved. It goes to a sibling, not to the installer's temporary directory:
# a directory cannot be renamed onto another drive, and %TEMP% may be on
# one. When Windows refuses, the removal is electron-builder's own, word for
# word (test/packaging.test.js compares it with the template), which also
# covers an uninstaller that had to be run from inside the directory.
#
# Windows also refuses while the directory is any program's working
# directory, and two programs have it for theirs: this uninstaller (its
# un.onInit goes there), and the new version's installer that is waiting for
# it. An update starts that installer from the running app without naming a
# working directory (electron-updater, BaseUpdater.spawnLog), so it has the
# app's, and the app's is the install directory whenever it was started from
# its shortcut, the relaunch after an update included. customInit below takes
# the installer out of it; the first lines of customRemoveFiles take the
# uninstaller out. Without customInit the rename was refused on every real
# update, and only an installer started from somewhere else got it.
#
# This is compiled into the uninstaller, so it works from the second update
# on: the version that is already installed is removed by its own.

# At the end of the installer's .onInit. Nothing between here and the old
# version's removal writes by a relative path, and the template goes back to
# $INSTDIR before it writes the new files (installSection.nsh).
