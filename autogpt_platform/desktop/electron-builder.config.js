// How the installers are built:
//

//
// One configuration for every kind of build. What differs between a
// developer's build and a signed release comes from the environment, so that
// nothing in the repository is edited to cut a release:
//
//   AUTOGPT_DESKTOP_VERSION    the app's version; package.json's
//                              0.0.0-dev.0 otherwise (a development build,
//                              which never looks for updates)
//   AUTOGPT_DESKTOP_OUTPUT     where the installers are written; dist
//   AUTOGPT_DESKTOP_VARIANT    the slug of a variant, such as "voice": an app
//                              that installs next to the normal one and
//                              shares nothing with it. Empty for the normal
//                              app. src/identity.js derives every name here
//                              from it; README.md, "Variants".
//   AUTOGPT_DESKTOP_MAC_SIGN   "developer-id": sign with the Developer ID
//                              certificate in CSC_LINK (or the keychain),
//                              hardened runtime, notarize. Anything else:
//                              ad-hoc signature, no hardened runtime.
//   AUTOGPT_DESKTOP_WIN_SIGN   "azure": Azure Trusted Signing, described by
//                              AZURE_SIGN_ENDPOINT, AZURE_SIGN_ACCOUNT,
//                              AZURE_SIGN_PROFILE and AZURE_SIGN_PUBLISHER.
//                              "pfx": the certificate in WIN_CSC_LINK.
//                              Anything else: unsigned.
//
// The certificates and passwords themselves are read by electron-builder
// from its own variables (CSC_LINK, CSC_KEY_PASSWORD, APPLE_API_KEY, ...,
// WIN_CSC_LINK, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, ...). They never pass through this file.
