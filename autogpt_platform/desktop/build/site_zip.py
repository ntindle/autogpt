"""Pack the pure-Python packages into a few files.

Two thirds of the bundle's files are third-party Python modules and their
bytecode: 16,000 of each. Python imports from a zip as readily as from a
directory, and a zip is one file to install, scan and replace instead of
thousands. The archives are in `site-zip/`, beside `site/` and after it on
the interpreter's path (build_runtime.py, step_relocate).

What goes in is decided a package at a time, never part of one: Python
cannot find one regular package in two places. A package goes in when
everything under it is Python source, or when its top-level name is on
DATA_READ_THROUGH_THE_LOADER and it has no other file than that list says.
It stays out when it has anything else (a compiled extension, a certificate
bundle, a template), when a .pth file imports it, when it is on ON_DISK, or
when a module of it names its own file (`__file__`, `__path__`): code that
does may open what is beside it by path, which a zip does not have (firecrawl
read its version that way, and reported a wrong one from a zip without
failing). The packages on NAMES_ITS_FILES do and go in all the same, each use
having been read. A directory without an `__init__.py`
and with nothing but directories in it is a namespace (`google`,
`opentelemetry`), which Python does assemble from several places: the
packages inside it are decided one by one. Top-level modules that are single
files, and every *.dist-info (importlib.metadata reads those as files), stay
where they are.

In a zip each module is stored with its bytecode beside it (`mod.py` and
`mod.pyc`, which is where zipimport looks), uncompressed: the installer
compresses the whole bundle anyway, and an uncompressed entry is read
without inflating it. The bytecode is the unchecked-hash kind, as for loose
files (step_compile), so it is trusted without a look at the source.
`without_bytecode` holds an archive to that: a module that is in one without
its bytecode imports all the same, compiled again by every process of every
start, and nothing else would show it.

What a module from a zip knows about itself differs from a file's in two
ways. Its `__file__` ends in `.pyc` (`.../site-zip/15.zip/openai/_client.pyc`):
zipimport names the entry it loaded. And its code is compiled under a name
that is the same on every build machine (`site-zip/openai/_client.py`), which
zipimport does not replace with where the archive is, as the import of a
.pyc file does. The second is put right as the interpreter starts
(build_runtime.RELOCATION): code loaded from an archive is renamed to its
source's place in it, so tracebacks, and packages that tell their own frames
from a caller's by file name (neo4j, e2b), see what they would see of files.

There are SHARDS archives and not one because of updates. An update
downloads the parts of the new installer that differ from the old one, and
the installer compresses each file of the bundle by itself: when a package
changes size, everything behind it in its archive moves, and the rest of
that archive compresses to other bytes. In one archive of everything that
was 16 MB of download for 16 bytes more in the middle (measured on the
Windows installer, 2026-10-03, the zipped packages being 28 MB of it); with
the packages dealt out over 32 archives by their names, a package that
changes takes its own archive with it and no other: 1 MB for the same 16
bytes in the archive that has openai, 4 MB in the largest (yt-dlp's). Which
archive a package is in depends on its name alone, so it stays there from
one build to the next. More archives would make an update smaller still and
every start slower: each is one more place the interpreter looks.

The Windows bundle's standard library goes the same way, into
`python313.zip` next to `python313.dll`, the layout of python.org's own
embeddable distribution. On macOS and Linux the standard library stays
loose: the interpreter there finds its home by `lib/python3.13/os.py`.
