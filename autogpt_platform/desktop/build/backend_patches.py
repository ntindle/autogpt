"""Changes to the backend, made to the bundle's copy of it.

The fork edits nothing under autogpt_platform/backend: upstream edits those
files every day, and each of ours would be a merge conflict
(runtime/tests/test_fork_surface.py). Where the desktop cannot work around
the backend from outside, the change is made here, to the copy the build
puts in the bundle, before that copy is compiled.

Each patch replaces one exact piece of text. The build stops when that text
is not in the file exactly once: upstream changed it, and somebody has to
look. runtime/tests/test_backend_patches.py finds that out earlier, against
the backend in the repository, on every run of the unit tests.

Each patch is also offered upstream, as upstream/<name>.patch (the same
change as a diff, with a test where one makes sense). When upstream has
merged one, delete it here and there.
