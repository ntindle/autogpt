"""The Claude Code CLI in the bundle is the one the locked SDK ships.

The backend's Docker image gets the CLI from one place: inside the
claude-agent-sdk wheel that backend/poetry.lock pins. The desktop bundle
installs the same locked SDK on every platform, and so carries the same CLI,
wherever that wheel exists.

Anthropic does not publish every SDK version for every platform (0.2.160 to
0.2.163 have no Windows wheel; 0.2.158 and 0.2.159 do). Where the locked
version has no wheel, the SDK installs from its source distribution, which
is the same Python code without the program. The build then puts the program
where the wheel would have: the official build of exactly the version that
SDK names (`_cli_version.py`), from Anthropic's release bucket, pinned by
digest in artifacts.py, byte for byte as published.

A bump of the lock that changes the CLI version stops the build until
artifacts.py names the new one: a bundle never carries a CLI other than the
one its SDK was built with. It stops on every platform, also where the wheel
brought the right program and nothing has to be downloaded, so that the pin
cannot go stale on the platforms that do not use it.
