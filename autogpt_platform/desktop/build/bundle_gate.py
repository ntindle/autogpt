"""What pruning and zipping must not have broken, asked of the bundle itself.

    <runtime>/python/python -B bundle_gate.py <runtime> [--imports FILE [--record]]

Run with the bundle's own interpreter, like the smoke test, and before it:
this takes two minutes and starts nothing.

  1. Every module of the backend imports. A module that does not is either
     on NOT_IMPORTABLE, with the reason, or a file the pruning should not
     have taken (build/backend_tests.py, build/slim.py, build/lock_export.py).
  2. `backend.blocks.load_all_blocks()` loads every block: the loader
     imports every file under blocks/, so this is what any service does as
     it starts.
  3. What packages keep as data still reaches them: a time zone through
     zoneinfo and through pytz, the certificate bundle, the version of an
     installed distribution, and aioclamd, which needs pkg_resources. And
     code loaded from a zip names the file it came from, as code loaded from
     a file does (build_runtime.RELOCATION).
  4. Every module of every zipped package (site-zip/) imports from its zip
     exactly as it did from files. `--imports FILE --record` writes down, before
     the packages are zipped, which modules import and which fail and how;
     `--imports FILE` afterwards compares. A module that failed before and
     fails the same way now is not this build's doing (an optional
     dependency that is not installed, a module for another platform). Each
     package is imported in the environment a service has: one that needs
     it (moviepy asks where ffmpeg is) would otherwise fail before and
     after, and none of its modules would have been tried from the zip. A
     zipped package that does not import at all is a finding for that
     reason, unless it is on MAY_NOT_IMPORT.

Exit code 1 when anything is wrong, with one line for each thing.
