"""Boot an assembled runtime, check that it serves, stop it, check it is gone.

    <runtime>/python/python smoke_test.py <runtime> [--timeout 600] [--quick]
                                          [--profile compact|balanced|isolated]
                                          [--data-dir DIR] [--keep] [--read-only]
                                          [--restart-budget SECONDS]

Run it with the bundle's own interpreter (it uses psutil, psycopg2 and redis
from the bundle). This is the shell's contract exercised without the shell:
start the runtime as the bundle's manifest says to, read JSON events from
stdout until `ready`, close stdin, expect exit code 0, no process it started
left running, and no file in the bundle changed.

Before anything is started, the backend in the bundle is checked against
what the service host depends on (runtime/tests/backend_contract.py).

While the first start is up, the stack itself is put to work: every service
answers, an agent runs to the right result, memory is inside the profile's
budget, the process hosting the executor is killed with a run in flight and
comes back to finish that run and take another. After every stop, each service host's log must show that
it was asked, cleaned up, and left by itself.

It starts the runtime three times on one data directory, because the owner
account's promises are about restarts:

  1. a fresh install: the first account to sign up is an admin at once, and
     a second sign-up is refused;
  2. a restart: the owner is still an admin, and the frontend now refuses
     sign-ups with its own "not allowed" message; runs left "running" by the
     first start are settled and its stale lock is gone;
  3. a restart with a password-reset file waiting, and nobody an admin: the
     old password stops working, the new one works, the owner is admin again.

Every start must come up on the address the first one had: sessions and OAuth
redirect URLs hang off it.

Every start is timed, by the runtime's own account of it (its `timing`
events: autogpt_desktop/timing.py), and the table is printed at the end. A
restart that takes longer than `--restart-budget` fails the run: see
RESTART_BUDGET_SECONDS.

`--quick` stops after the first.

The bundle is the installed app's, so a run may leave nothing in it: no file
or directory added, changed or removed (the Next server's caches are probed
on purpose), and nothing fetched. The runtime is started with every proxy
variable pointing at a closed port, which the Prisma CLI (the one part of the
stack that would download something, an engine, when it found none it liked)
inherits: a download fails the migration instead of quietly succeeding.
`--read-only` (macOS and Linux) goes further and takes write permission off
the whole bundle for the run, as a system-wide install or a mounted AppImage
has it, then also fails on any service log that mentions being refused.

Without `--data-dir` the data directory is a temporary one, removed when the
run ends, however it ends (a signal that asks it to end included); `--keep`
leaves it. One given with `--data-dir` is the caller's and is left alone.
Either way, the space-free links the runtime made outside the data directory
during the run are removed (autogpt_desktop/rabbitmq.py).
