// The shell knows nothing about Postgres, Python or ports. It starts one
// runtime process and listens to it. The runtime reports its state as one JSON
// object per stdout line:
//
//   {"event": "progress", "step": "postgres", "message": "Starting the database"}
//   {"event": "ready", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:43117"}
//   {"event": "error", "message": "...", "fatal": true}
//   {"event": "timing", "phase": "queue", "seconds": 6.3}
//
// `timing` says how long a part of the start took, and once more for the
// whole of it ("phase": "total", with every phase in "phases"). It is for
// the log and for the smoke test; the window shows nothing for it.
//
// Anything on stdout that is not a JSON object is treated as a log line.
// The shell asks the runtime to stop by closing its stdin. Signals do not
// reach a console-less child on Windows, and a closed pipe also covers the
// shell crashing: the runtime sees EOF either way and shuts its services down.
//
// A runtime that has not exited some time after being asked to is killed. One
// that knows its stop will be slow says how long it needs, on any event:
//
//   {"event": "progress", "message": "Finishing a database update", "grace_seconds": 960}
