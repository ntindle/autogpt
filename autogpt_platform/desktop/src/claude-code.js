// When the Claude Code CLI on this machine is signed in, AutoPilot uses that
// sign-in and its turns count against the user's Claude plan
// (runtime/autogpt_desktop/claude_code.py). Nothing is configured for it, so
// the app has to say that it is happening. The runtime reports what it found
// once per start:
//
//   {"event": "claude_code", "state": "in_use", "cli": "...", "version": "2.1.284", "bundled": true}
//
// The line is information, never a control: the app has no Claude sign-in of
// its own and no field for a token. Signing in is done with Claude Code
// itself (`claude`), and the runtime looks only while it starts, so every
// line that asks for something ends in a restart.

// claude_code.py: IN_USE, SIGNED_OUT, NO_ANSWER, NOT_FOUND, OFF, REFUSED.
