"""One process that hosts backend services, and stops them properly.

    python -c "<apps.HOST_CODE>" <package parent> --name workers \
        executor=backend.exec:main scheduler=backend.scheduler:main ...

Every backend service process is one of these, whether it hosts five
services or one. Each upstream entry point is `run_processes(SomeService())`,
so putting a collector in place of `backend.app.run_processes` before the
entry modules are imported hands over upstream's own service objects, built
with upstream's own arguments, without starting them. Each then runs in a
thread of its own, exactly as it would in a process of its own:
`service.start(background=False)`. The main thread stays the host's.

While the app starts, the supervisor starts the hosts before the databases
are up, so that the slow part (importing the backend) overlaps theirs. It
names a file in GO_FILE_ENV; a host that is given one imports its services'
modules and then waits for the file to exist. Only then does it call an
entry point: one that hands its service over costs milliseconds to call (the
five of the largest host took 4 ms together, 2026-10-03), and one that has
come to run its service itself (the case `entry_point_is_serving` is for)
starts it right there, which must not be before the databases answer and
the migrations are in.

A stop is asked for with SIGTERM, or on Windows (where a signal cannot reach
a console-less process) by setting a named event the supervisor created. The
host then calls every service's `cleanup()` at once, waits for them just
short of the time the supervisor allows, and exits. Windows services never
ran their cleanup before.

With `--shared-loop`, `uvicorn.run` serves every app on one event loop: the
backend's database client belongs to the loop that connected it, so the two
API servers can share an interpreter only if they share a loop.

Everything this module needs from upstream:

    backend.app.run_processes            the seam the services are taken from
    AppProcess.start(background=False)   runs a service in the calling thread
    AppProcess.cleanup()                 its shutdown
    AppProcess.service_name              for the log
    backend.data.db.is_connected()       the watchdog below
    uvicorn.run                          what the two API servers call

tests/backend_contract.py checks each against the real backend. When one is
broken here, a host of several services exits with EXIT_CONTRACT and the
supervisor starts each service in a host of its own; a host of one service
runs it the way upstream would have, in the foreground.

Only the standard library is imported until the services are: this module is
also imported by the supervisor and by tests that have no backend.
