"""AutoGPT's own processes: the backend services and the Next server.

The same services the appliance's supervisord runs
(supervisor/supervisord.conf) minus the opt-in chat-bot ones. Each is
upstream's own entry point, called through the bundled interpreter rather
than the console scripts pip generates: those carry absolute shebangs that
break as soon as the app bundle is moved.

Every service process is a service host (servicehost.py), whether it hosts
one service or several. By default they are grouped, because each
interpreter that imports the backend costs about 600 MB:

    database-manager   alone: it is the others' way to the database
    workers            the five services that never connect to the database
    api                the two API servers, on one event loop

`isolated()` is one host per service: what the `isolated` profile runs, and
what a group is replaced with when upstream stops fitting it.
`copilot_alone()` takes the copilot executor out of its group, when it is
the one service that runs in the user's own home directory (claude_code.py).
