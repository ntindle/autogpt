"""Agent runs and AutoPilot turns that were in flight when a process died.

An executor takes a lock in Valkey for each run it works on, valid for five
minutes and written to disk. A new executor that finds the lock of a dead
one takes the run for someone else's, drops its message, and the run stays
"running" for ever. On a desktop there is one executor, so a lock that
exists before it starts is always a dead one's: `Cache.clear_stale_locks`
removes them before every start of the process that hosts an executor, at
boot and when the supervisor restarts it. The run's message is still in the
queue, and the platform then picks the run up where it left off.

`reconcile` is the other half, run once per boot before any service starts:
a run the user chose to stop does not come back, and one that has been
"running" for more than a day is not resumed out of the blue.

Nothing here may stop the app from starting. Every name below is upstream's
(tests/test_upstream_names.py checks them), and every failure is logged and
skipped.
