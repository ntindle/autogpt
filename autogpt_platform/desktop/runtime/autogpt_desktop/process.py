"""Child processes that cannot outlive the runtime.

Supervisor in the appliance relies on the container dying with PID 1. A
desktop has no such boundary, so it is rebuilt here:

* Windows: the runtime joins a Job Object with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE before it
  starts anything. Children inherit the job, and Windows kills all of them
  the moment the runtime's last handle closes, crash or not.
* POSIX: each child leads its own session, so a terminal's Ctrl+C reaches
  only the runtime (which then stops services in order) and a child can be
  killed together with whatever it started: the process that matters is
  often not the one launched (rabbitmq-server is a shell script that waits
  on the Erlang VM). Every child's (pid, start time) is recorded so that
  the shell, or the next boot, can kill what a dead runtime left running.
