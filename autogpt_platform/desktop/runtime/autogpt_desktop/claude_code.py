"""AutoPilot on the user's own Claude Code sign-in.

When the Claude Code CLI on this machine is signed in, AutoPilot runs on that
sign-in: its turns count against the user's Claude plan, and no API key is
needed. Nothing is configured for it. `AUTOGPT_CLAUDE_CODE=off` turns it off,
in settings.env or in the environment the app is started with, as do the
backend's own switches in settings.env
(`CHAT_USE_CLAUDE_CODE_SUBSCRIPTION=false`, `CHAT_USE_LOCAL=true`).

The sign-in itself is never touched. The runtime only ever starts the stock
CLI (`--version`, `auth status`) and reads the two answers: no credentials
file, keychain entry or token is opened, copied or logged, and neither is
the account's email, which `auth status` prints. The backend finds the
sign-in the way the user's own terminal does, because the copilot executor
then runs in a process of its own (apps.copilot_alone) that is given the
user's real home directory (settings.claude_code_host_environment). Every
other process keeps the app's private one.

The CLI is started only in a home where Claude Code has been used before
(`used_in`): `auth status` sets up `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude` where
there are none, and a machine without Claude Code must stay without them.

Which CLI: the one the Claude Agent SDK bundles, when the bundle has it. It
is the version the SDK was built against, the binary the Docker image runs,
and the one the backend's own check asks whether it is signed in
(backend/copilot/sdk/subscription.py: the bundled binary, else `claude` on
PATH). The user's own install is used only where none is bundled.
`AUTOGPT_CLAUDE_CLI=<path>` in settings.env names another one.

It is read once, while the app starts: signing in or out of Claude Code takes
effect the next time the app starts.
