"""PostgreSQL, adapted from single-container/entrypoint.sh `initialize_postgres`.

Differences from the appliance: no peer authentication (Windows has none),
so every role, the frontend's included, authenticates with scram over
loopback TCP; and the port is whatever ports.py picked.

On Windows the server is started through `pg_ctl start`, for every user:
postgres.exe refuses to run for an account with administrative rights (an
elevated shell, a CI runner), and pg_ctl starts it with those rights taken
away. See `WindowsServer`.
