"""Where the time of a start goes.

Each phase is reported as it ends, in the log and to the shell, and the start
ends with one line that has them all:

    started in 41 s (database 2.1, cache 0.6, queue 9.8, migrations 4.0,
    services 27.5, frontend 3.2)

Phases overlap (the queue boots while the migrations run), so they do not add
up to the total. A phase is the time between its work being started and its
result being seen: `queue` is from launching RabbitMQ to its first answer.
Each server is asked by a thread that does nothing else meanwhile
(supervisor.py: the cache and the broker on theirs, the frontend on its own),
so a phase is that server's time and not the wait for whatever the start was
busy with before it asked. `services` begins when the hosts are launched and
ends when what the window talks to answers, which is after the go.
build/smoke_test.py prints these for every start and holds a restart to a
budget.
