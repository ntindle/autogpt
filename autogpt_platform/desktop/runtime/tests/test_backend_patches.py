"""The backend is changed in the bundle's copy, and nowhere else.

build/backend_patches.py replaces exact pieces of the backend's text while a
bundle is built. These tests try every patch on the backend in the
repository, so that an upstream change to those lines stops the unit tests
(and the daily upstream sync that runs them) and not a build days later; and
they hold each patch equal to the diff offered upstream for it
(desktop/upstream/), so the bundle runs what upstream is asked to merge.
